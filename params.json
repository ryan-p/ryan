{"name":"Ryan's Home","tagline":"","body":"# the first time to use libcurl\r\n\r\nI began to use libcurl yesterday. My idea is that I want to use libcurl in my program to download something from a website. I coded with the help of some guide on-line. When I finished my coding, I compiled and got the binary executable file. I ran it and got a file as I intened. But the size of the file is 0 byte!\r\n\r\nSo I began to debug to find out what is the problem. Finally I found it out this morning! It was a very basic mistake... When I passed an argument (a CURL handle) into the function I designed to init a CURL connection, I used the \"call-by-value\" style, which actually made everything I did in the function invisible outside, so the value of the handler I passed to the function is always \"NULL\". So when I use \"curl_easy_perform\", it did nothing.\r\n\r\nThis is the first story happened in my journey of \"developing something for my master's degree. Best wishes for myself, haha ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
